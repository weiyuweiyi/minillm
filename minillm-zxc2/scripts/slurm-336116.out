/home/bingxing2/home/scx7atk/work/minillm/transformers/src/transformers/generation/configuration_utils.py:381: UserWarning: `do_sample` is set to `False`. However, `temperature` is set to `0.9` -- this flag is only used in sample-based generation modes. You should set `do_sample=True` or unset `temperature`. This was detected when initializing the generation config instance, which means the corresponding file may hold incorrect parameterization and should be fixed.
